      <h3>Welcome to the Cameron University Library Combat Veterans Historical 
      Site</h3>

      <p>
      This site is about interviews with Southwest Oklahoma Area veterans about their 
      combat experiences in various theater of conflicts and wars. 
      <br><br>
      </p>
     
     <h3>Their Story</h3>

     <p>
      The audio interviews with the veterans about their combat 
      experiences show how they defended our country by showcasing American 
      values of bravery, duty, honesty, and integrity. The listener will gain a 
      deeper understanding of the what, why, and how every veteran has 
      sacrificed to successfully complete the missions given to them by 
      every U.S. President, the Commander-In-Chief.
     <br><br>
     </p>
     <p>
      The site hopes to present to the general public these in-depth profiles of these heroes 
      concerning their accomplishments, struggles, and obstacles they've overcome in 
      order to protect our democracy.
