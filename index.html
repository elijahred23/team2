      <h3>WELCOME</h3>

      <p>
      The Cameron University Veterans History Project site has collected interviews from combat veterans living 
      Southwest Oklahoma area. The site's purpose is to preserve, and make accessible, the personal accounts of
      these veterans so that it is possible for future generations may hear directly from the veterans in order
      to have a deeper understanding of the realities of war.

      The site contains the audio interviews with the veterans about their combat 
      experiences.
